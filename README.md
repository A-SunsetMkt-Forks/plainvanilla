# Plain Vanilla

A website demonstrating how to do web development using only vanilla techniques: no tools, no frameworks, just the browser and vanilla web code. The site itself is also built in this way.

## Running

Run the `public/` folder as a static website:

- node: `npx serve public`
- php: `php -S localhost:8000 -t public`
- python: `python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory public`

Or use the VS Code Live Preview extension to show `public/index.html`.
