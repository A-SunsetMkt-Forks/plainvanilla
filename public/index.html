                This is an overview of the major techniques used to make web sites and web applications
                without making use of build tools or frameworks, with just an editor, a browser, and web standards.

                Wait, but why
            </h2>
            <p>
                Modern web development tooling is powerful but very complicated,
                and the resulting projects often require regular maintenance to keep secure and up to date.
                The plain vanilla style of web development makes a different choice,
                trading off a few short term comforts for long term benefits like simplicity and being effectively zero-maintenance.
                This approach is made possible by the modern browser landscape, which offers excellent web standards support.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Don't</strong> use the plain vanilla approach until you've tried some of the popular web development frameworks
                and have learned why you might want to do without.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Do</strong> use this approach if you want to get more familiar with the tools that the browser offers, or if you want to build a site or application that requires no maintenance, is very reliable, and is built for the long haul.
                After all, the techniques described here rely on nothing but web standards, and web standards last for decades.
            </p>
