                This is an overview of the major techniques used to make web sites and web applications
                without making use of build tools or frameworks, with just an editor, a browser, and web standards.
            </p>

                Wait, but why
            </h2>
            <p>
                Modern web development tooling is powerful but very complicated,
                and the resulting projects often require regular maintenance to keep secure and up to date.
                The plain vanilla style of web development makes a different choice,
                trading off a few short-term comforts for long term benefits like simplicity and being effectively zero-maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Don't</strong> use the plain vanilla approach if you're uncertain about what approach to use,
                if you favor speed of development above all else, or if you need extensive integration with a database backend.
                Instead use something that's commonplace like React and/or Laravel because they offer more conveniences and when you run into problems
                it will be easier to find answers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Do</strong> use this approach if you want to build a site or application that requires no maintenance, is very reliable, and is built for the long haul.
                After all, the techniques described here rely on nothing but web standards, and web standards last for decades.
            </p>
