            When first taught about the wave-particle duality of light most people's brains does a double take.
            How can light be two different categories of things at the same time, both a wave and a particle? That's just weird.
            The same thing happens with web components, confusing people when they first try to learn them and run into their Document-JavaScript duality.
            The component systems in frameworks are typically JavaScript-first, only using the DOM as an outlet for their visual appearance.
            Web components however &mdash; or custom elements to be precise &mdash; can start out in either JavaScript or the document, and are married to neither.
        </p>

        <h3>Just the DOM please</h3>

        <p>
            Do you want to see the minimal JavaScript code needed to set up an <code>&lt;x-example&gt;</code> custom element?
            Here it is:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            No, that's not a typo. Custom elements can be used just fine without any JavaScript.
            Consider this example of an <code>&lt;x-tooltip&gt;</code> custom element that is HTML and CSS only:
        </p>
        <iframe src="undefined/example.html" name="undefined custom element" height="75"></iframe>
        <x-code-viewer src="undefined/example.html" name="example.html"></x-code-viewer>
        <p>
            <small>For the curious, here is the <a href="undefined/example.css">example.css</a>, but it is not important here.</small>
        </p>
        <p>
            Such elements are called <em>undefined custom elements</em>.
            Before custom elements are defined in the window by calling <code>customElements.define()</code> they always start out in this state.
            There is no need to actually define the custom element if it can be solved in a pure CSS way.
            In fact, many "pure CSS" components found online can be solved by such custom elements,
            by styling the element itself and its <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements.
        </p>

        <h3>A question of definition</h3>

        <p>
            The CSS-only representation of the custom element can be progressively enhanced by connecting it up to a JavaScript counterpart,
            a custom element class. This is a class that inherits from <code>HTMLElement</code> and allows the custom element
            to implement its own logic.
        </p>
        <iframe src="defined/example.html" name="defining the custom element" height="125"></iframe>
        <x-code-viewer src="defined/example.html" name="example.html"></x-code-viewer>
        <p>
            What happens to the elements already in the markup at the moment <code>customElements.define()</code>
            is called is an <em>element upgrade</em>. The browser will take all custom elements already in the document,
            and create an instance of the matching custom element class that it connects them to.
            This class enables the element to control its own part of the DOM, but also allows it to react to what happens in the DOM.
        </p>
        <p>
            Element upgrades occur for existing custom elements in the document when <code>customElements.define()</code> is called,
            and for all new custom elements with that tag name created afterwards (e.g. using <code>document.createElement('x-example')</code>).
            It does not occur automatically for detached custom elements (not part of the document) that were created before the element was defined.
            Those can be upgraded retroactively by calling <code>customElements.upgrade()</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            So far, this is the part of the lifecycle we've seen:
        </p>
        <pre>
&lt;undefined&gt; 
    -> define() -> &lt;defined&gt;
    -> automatic upgrade() 
                -> constructor() 
                -> &lt;constructed&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>
            The constructor as shown in the example above is optional, but if it is specified then it has a <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-element-conformance">number of gotcha's</a>:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>It must start with a call to <code>super()</code>.</dt>
            <dt>It should not make DOM changes yet, as the element is not yet guaranteed to be connected to the DOM.</dt>
            <dd>
                This includes reading or modifying its own DOM properties, like its attributes.
                The tricky part is that in the constructor the element might already be in the DOM,
                so setting attributes might work. Or it might give an error. It's best to avoid DOM interaction altogether in the constructor.
            </dd>
            <dt>It should initialize its state, like class properties</dt>
            <dd>
                But work done in the constructor should be minimized and maximally postponed until <code>connectedCallback</code>.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Making connections</h3>

        <p>
            After being constructed, if the element was already in the document, its <code>connectedCallback()</code> handler is called.
            This handler is normally called only when the element is inserted into the document, but for elements that are already in the document when they are defined it ends up being called as well.
            In this handler DOM changes can be made, and in the example above the <code>status</code> attribute is set to demonstrate this.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>connectedCallback()</em> handler is part of what is known in the HTML standard as <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-element-reactions">custom element reactions</a>:
            These reactions allow the element to respond to various changes to the DOM:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>connectedCallback()</code> is called when the element is inserted into the document, even if it was only moved from a different place in the same document.</li>
            <li><code>disconnectedCallback()</code> is called when the element is removed from the document.</li>
            <li><code>adoptedCallback()</code> is called when the element is moved to a new document. (You are unlikely to need this in practice.)</li>
            <li><code>attributeChangedCallback()</code> is called when an attribute is changed, but only for the attributes listed in its <code>observedAttributes</code> property.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are also special reactions for <a href="https://dev.to/stuffbreaker/custom-forms-with-web-components-and-elementinternals-4jaj">form-associated custom elements</a>, 
            but those are a rabbit hole beyond the purview of this blog post.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are more gotcha's to these reactions:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>connectedCallback()</code> and <code>disconnectedCallback()</code> can be called multiple times</dt>
            <dd>
                This can occur when the element is moved around in the document.
                These handlers should be written in such a way that it is harmless to run them multiple times,
                e.g. by doing an early exit when it is detected that <em>connectedCallback()</em> was already run.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>attributeChangedCallback()</code> can be called before <code>connectedCallback()</code></dt>
            <dd>
                For all attributes already set when the element in the document is upgraded,
                the <em>attributeChangedCallback()</em> handler will be called first,
                and only after this <em>connectedCallback()</em> is called.
                The unpleasant consequence is that any <em>attributeChangedCallback</em> that tries to update DOM structures
                created in <em>connectedCallback</em> can produce errors.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>attributeChangedCallback()</code> is only called for attribute changes, not property changes.</dt>
            <dd>
                Attribute changes can be done in Javascript by calling <code>element.setAttribute('name', 'value')</code>.
                DOM attributes and class properties can have the same name, but are not automatically linked.
                Generally for this reason it is better to avoid having attributes and properties with the same name.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            The lifecycle covered up to this point for elements that start out in the initial document:
        </p>
        <pre>
&lt;undefined&gt; 
    -> define() -> &lt;defined&gt;
    -> automatic upgrade() 
                -> [element].constructor()
                -> [element].attributeChangedCallback()
                -> [element].connectedCallback() 
                -> &lt;connected&gt;
        </pre>

        <h3>Flip the script</h3>

        <p>
            So far we've covered one half of the Document-JavaScript duality, for custom elements starting out in the document,
            and only after that becoming defined and gaining a JavaScript counterpart.
            It is however also possible to reverse the flow, and start out from JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the minimal code to create a custom element in JavaScript: <code>document.createElement('x-example')</code>.
            The element does not need to be defined in order to run this code, although it can be, and the resulting node can be inserted into the document
            as if it was part of the original HTML markup.
        </p>
        <p>
            If it is inserted, and after insertion the element becomes defined, then it will behave as described above.
            Things are however different if the element remains detached:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>The detached element will not be automatically upgraded when it is defined.</dt>
            <dd>
                The constructor or reactions will not be called. It will be automatically upgraded when it is inserted into the document.
                It can also be upgraded explicitly by calling <code>customElements.upgrade()</code>.
            </dd>
            <dt>If the detached element is already defined when it is created, it will be upgraded automatically.</dt>
            <dd>The <em>constructor()</em> and <em>attributeChangedCallback()</em> will be called. Because it is not yet part of the document <em>connectedCallback()</em> won't be.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            By now no doubt you are a bit confused. Here's an interactive playground that lets you test
            what happens to elements as they go through their lifecycle, both for those in the initial document and those created dynamically.
        </p>
        <iframe src="defined2/example.html" name="custom element lifecycle" height="600"></iframe>

        <p>Here are some interesting things to try out:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Create</em>, then <em>Define</em>, and you will see that the created element is not upgraded automatically because it is detached from the document.</li>
            <li><em>Create</em>, then <em>Connect</em>, then <em>Define</em>, and you will see that the element is upgraded automatically because it is in the document.</li>
            <li><em>Define</em>, then <em>Create</em>, and you will see that the element is upgraded as soon as it is created (<em>constructed</em> appears in the reactions).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I tried writing a flowchart of all possible paths through the lifecycle that can be seen in this example,
            but it got so unwieldy that I think it's better to just play around with the example until a solid grasp develops.
        </p>

        <h3>In the shadows</h3>

        <p>
            Adding shadow DOM creates yet another wrinkle in the lifecycle.
            At any point in the element's JavaScript half, including in its constructor, a shadow DOM can be attached to the element by calling <code>attachShadow()</code>.
            Because the shadow DOM is immediately available for DOM operations, that makes it possible to do those DOM operations in the constructor.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this next interactive example you can see what happens when the shadow DOM becomes attached.
            The <em>x-shadowed</em> element will immediately attach a shadow DOM in its constructor,
            which happens when the element is upgraded automatically after defining.
            The <em>x-shadowed-later</em> element postpones adding a shadow DOM until a link is clicked,
            so the element first starts out as a non-shadowed custom element, and adds a shadow DOM later.
        </p>

        <iframe src="shadowed/example.html" name="shadowed custom elements"></iframe>
        <x-code-viewer src="shadowed/example.html" name="example.html"></x-code-viewer>

        <p>
            While adding a shadow DOM can be done at any point, it is a one-way operation.
            Once added the shadow DOM will replace the element's original contents, and this cannot be undone.
        </p>

        <h3>Keeping an eye out</h3>

        <p>
            So far we've mostly been dealing with initial setup of the custom element,
            but a major part of the lifecycle is responding to changes as they occur.
            Here are some of the major ways that custom elements can respond to DOM changes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>connectedCallback</em> and <em>disconnectedCallback</em> to handle DOM insert and remove of the element itself.</li>
            <li><em>attributeChangedCallback</em> to handle attribute changes of the element.</li>
            <li>For shadowed custom elements, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLSlotElement/slotchange_event">slotchange</a> event can be used to detect when children are added and removed in a <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>.</li>
            <li>Saving the best for last, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver">MutationObserver</a> can be used to monitor DOM subtree changes, as well as attribute changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>MutationObserver</em> in particular is worth exploring, because it is a swiss army knife for monitoring the DOM.
            Here's an example of a counter that automatically updates when new child elements are added:
        </p>
        <iframe src="observer/example.html" name="custom element with observer"></iframe>
        <x-code-viewer src="observer/example.html" name="example.html"></x-code-viewer>

        <p>
            There is still more to tell, but already I can feel eyes glazing over and brains turning to mush,
            so I will keep the rest for another day.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <p>
            Phew, that was a much longer story than I originally set out to write, but custom elements have surprising intricacy.
            I hope you found it useful, and if not at least you got to see some code and click some buttons.
            It's all about the clicking of the buttons.
