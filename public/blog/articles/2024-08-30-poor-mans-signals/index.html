            Signals are all the rage right now. Everyone's doing them.
            <a href="https://angular.dev/guide/signals">Angular</a>,
            and <a href="https://docs.solidjs.com/concepts/signals">Solid</a>,
            and <a href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/">Preact</a>,
            and there are third party packages for just about every framework that doesn't already have them.
            There's even a <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals">proposal</a>
            to add them to the language, and if that passes it's just a 
            <a href="https://thenewstack.io/did-signals-just-land-in-react/">matter of time</a> before all frameworks 
            have them built in.
        </p>

        <h3>Living under a rock</h3>
        <p>
            In case you've been living under a rock, here's the example from Preact's documentation 
            that neatly summarizes what signals do:
        </p>
        <x-code-viewer src="preact-example.js" name=""></x-code-viewer>
        <p>
            Simply put, signals wrap values and computations 
            in a way that allows us to easily respond to every change to those values and results in a targeted way,
            without having to rerender the entire application in the way that we would do in React.
            In short, signals are an efficient and targeted way to respond to changes without having to do state comparison and DOM-diffing.
        </p>
        <p>
            OK, so, if signals are so great, why am I trying to sell you on them on a vanilla web development blog?
            Don't worry! Vanilla web developers can have signals too.
        </p>

        <h3>Just a wrapper</h3>
        <p>
            Signals are at heart nothing more than a wrapper for a value that sends events when the value changes.
            That's nothing that a little trickery with the not well known but very handy <code>EventTarget</code> base class can't fix for us.
        </p>
        <x-code-viewer src="signals1.js" name=""></x-code-viewer>
        <p>
            This gets us a very barebones signals experience:
        </p>
        <x-code-viewer src="signals1-use.js" name=""></x-code-viewer>
        <p>
            But that's kind of ugly. The <code>new</code> keyword went out of fashion a decade ago,
            and that <code>addEventListener</code> sure is unwieldy.
            So let's add a little syntactic sugar.
        </p>
        <x-code-viewer src="signals2.js" name=""></x-code-viewer>
        <p>
            Now our barebones example is a lot nicer to use:
        </p>
        <x-code-viewer src="signals2-use.js" name=""></x-code-viewer>
        <p>
            The <code>effect(fn)</code> method will call the specified function,
            and also subscribe it to changes in the signal's value.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also returns a dispose function that can be used to unregister the effect.
            However, a nice side effect of using <code>EventTarget</code> and browser built-in events as the reactivity primitive
            is that it makes the browser smart enough to garbage collect the signal and its effect when the signal goes out of scope.
            This means less chance for memory leaks even if we never call the dispose function.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code> magic methods allow for dropping <code>.value</code> in most places
            that the signal's value gets used. (But not in this example, because the console is far too clever for that.)
        </p>

        <h3>Does not compute</h3>
        <p>
            This signals implementation is already capable, but at some point it might be handy to have an effect based on more than one signal.
            That means supporting computed values. Where the base signals are a wrapper around a value,
            computed signals are a wrapper around a function.
        </p>
        <x-code-viewer src="signals3.js" name=""></x-code-viewer>
        <p>
            The computed signal calculates its value from a function.
            It also depends on other signals, and when they change it will recompute its value.
            It's a bit obnoxious to have to pass the signals that it depends on
            as an additional parameter, but hey, I didn't title this article <em>Rich man's signals</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This enables porting Preact's signals example to vanilla JS.
        </p>
        <x-code-viewer src="signals3-use.js" name=""></x-code-viewer>

        <h3>Can you use it in a sentence?</h3>
        <p>
            You may be thinking, all these <code>console.log</code> examples are fine and dandy,
            but how do you use this stuff in actual web development?
            This simple adder demonstrates how signals can be combined with web components:
        </p>
        <x-code-viewer src="adder.js"></x-code-viewer>
        <p>
            And here's a live demo:
        </p>
        <iframe src="adder.html" name="Adder example"></iframe>
        <p>
            In case you were wondering, the <code>if</code> is there to prevent adding the effect twice
            if connectedCallback is called when the component is already rendered.
        </p>
